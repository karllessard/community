## Objective

Simplify and improve performances of creating tensors in Java by writing and reading 
directly to/from their native buffers, while preserving their internal format.

## Motivation

Currently, the easiest way to create tensors in Java is by invoking one of the
factory methods exposed by the [`Tensors`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/Tensors.java)
class. While their signatures are elegant, by accepting concrete Java objects and 
multi-dimensional arrays, they make heavy use of reflection techniques to extract 
the shape and the size of the tensors to allocate. This results in poor performances,
as discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8244).

Reading tensor data uses a [similar approach](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c23fd17c3781b21bd3309faa13fad58472c78e93/tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/Tensor.java#L449) and faces also performance issues. 
In addition, it requires in some cases that the user allocates a new buffer on the heap
into which the tensor data is copied (see [`writeTo()`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c23fd17c3781b21bd3309faa13fad58472c78e93/tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/Tensor.java#L483) methods, for example), which is not convenient when dealing
with large tensors.

Now that eager execution environment is (almost) supported by the Java client, it is imperative that the 
I/O operations between the native tensor buffers and the JVM are efficient enough to let the users peek at 
their data and, in some cases, modify it without an important performance hit.

By developing a new set of I/O utility classes, we can allow the user to access directly the tensor data 
buffers while still preventing mistakes that could break their internal format (the main reason why the
tensor buffer is not publicly exposed at this moment). Also, those utilities will help navigating into 
multidimensional arrays flattened into tensor buffers, using indexation features similar to NumPy.

## User Benefit

Users who are actually using factories and read/write methods from `Tensors/Tensor` classes might observe great 
performance improvements after switching to the new set of I/O utilities.

Users executing their operations in an eager environment will also find very useful and efficient 
to access directly the tensor data without the need of copying their buffer.

## Design Proposal

*Note: This design proposal assumes that we run in a Java >= 8 environment, which is not the case with
current client that is set to compile in Java 7 for supporting older Android devices. We need to confirm
with Android team if it is ok now to switch to Java 8.*

### Initializing Tensor Data

Currently, when creating tensors, temporary buffers must be allocated by the user to collect the initial data
and copy it to the tensor memory (see [this link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a6003151399ba48d855681ec8e736387960ef06e/tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/Tensor.java#L187) for example). 
In most cases, temporary buffers won't be required anymore by writing the initial tensor data directly into the 
native tensor buffer.

Since tensor buffers are not resizable, the size in bytes of a tensor must be known at its creation time. 
This is quite trival for tensors with fixed-length datatype (like any numeric type). For variable-length 
datatypes though (like strings), this represents more a challenge as the values of the tensor elements 
has an impact on the required memory space.

Following factory will be added to the `Tensor` class:
```
public static <T> Tensor<T> create(Class<T> type, long[] shape, Consumer<TensorWriter<T>> dataInit);
```
If the size in bytes of the tensor can be determined, the method first creates an empty `Tensor` and then 
invoke the `dataInit` function to initialize the tensor data, using the provided `TensorWriter<T>` 
(which interface will be described later in this document).

If the size in bytes of the tensor cannot be determined, the only difference is that the `TensorWriter<T>`
will first collect all data in a temporary buffer and then create a `Tensor` from this data with the 
right computed size.





This is the meat of the document, where you explain your proposal. If you have
multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better separation of the
idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there are alternatives that you
have eliminated, you should also list those here, and explain why you believe
your chosen approach is superior.

Factors to consider include:

* performance implications
* dependencies
* maintenance
* platforms and environments impacted (e.g. hardware, cloud, other software
  ecosystems)
* [compatibility](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/version_compat)
* how will this change impact users, and how will that be managed?

## Detailed Design

This section is optional. Elaborate on details if theyâ€™re important to
understanding the design, but would make it hard to read the proposal section
above.
